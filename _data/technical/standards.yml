# DEFLECTION REQUIREMENTS
# ==
deflection_requirements:
  ceramic_tile:
    maximum: "L/360"
    description: "Span length (inches) divided by 360"
    example: "10 ft span (120\") = max 1/3\" deflection"
  natural_stone:
    maximum: "L/720"
    description: "Span length (inches) divided by 720"
    example: "10 ft span (120\") = max 1/6\" deflection"
  notes: >
    Deflection is measured under total live and dead loads.
    Excessive deflection causes grout and tile cracking.
    Stone requires stricter deflection limits due to brittleness.

# ==
# PRO NOTES: COMMON FAILURE POINTS
# ==
pro_notes_failure_prevention:
  mortar_coverage:
    issue: "Insufficient mortar coverage leads to tile cracking and hollow spots"
    prevention:
      - "Always lift test tiles to verify coverage"
      - "Comb mortar in ONE direction (not swirling)"
      - "Press tile perpendicular to ridges to collapse them"
      - "Back-butter large format tile (≥15\") and tiles with deep lugs"
      - "Use U-notch trowel for LFT - promotes better ridge collapse"
  
  lippage:
    issue: "Height differences between adjacent tiles"
    prevention:
      - "Verify substrate meets flatness tolerances BEFORE starting"
      - "Use leveling system (clips/wedges) for large format tile"
      - "Limit offset patterns to 33% max for tiles ≥15\""
      - "Check tile boxes for warpage - return excessively warped tiles"
  
  movement_joints:
    issue: "Cracking, tenting, or debonding due to expansion/contraction"
    prevention:
      - "Install perimeter joints at ALL restraining surfaces"
      - "Install field joints per TCNA EJ171 spacing requirements"
      - "Honor ALL substrate control joints through tile"
      - "Never grout movement joints - use sealant only"
      - "Use backer rod to prevent three-sided adhesion"
  
  waterproofing:
    issue: "Water intrusion causing mold, substrate damage, structural issues"
    prevention:
      - "Apply correct thickness per TDS (typically 2 coats)"
      - "Embed fabric tape at seams and changes of plane"
      - "Pre-form corners with KERDI-KERECK or fabric corners"
      - "Flood test before tiling (per TCNA/manufacturer)"
      - "Extend membrane min 3\" beyond wet area"

# HOW STANDARDS ARE USED IN CALCULATORS
# ==
calculator_compliance_notes:
  mortar_calculator: >
    Trowel selection follows TCNA and CBP VersaBond LFT TDS recommendations.
    Coverage requirements per ANSI A108: minimum 80% dry areas, 95% wet areas.
    For LFT ≥15\": use U-notch trowel (NOT 1/2\" square) per manufacturer TDS.
    Back-buttering required per ANSI A108.5 when 95% coverage specified.
  
  grout_calculator: >
    Joint width per ANSI A108.02: minimum 1/16\", at least 3× tile facial variation.
    Sanded vs. unsanded per ANSI A118.6: sanded ≥1/8\", unsanded <1/8\".
    Formula is mathematical (joint volume calculation), not standard-mandated.
  
  waterproofing_calculator: >
    Products listed claim ANSI A118.10 and/or A118.12 compliance.
    Coverage rates from manufacturer TDS, not from ANSI standard.
    ANSI standard defines performance, not coverage rates.
    Two coats required for ANSI A118.10 compliance.
  
  slope_calculator: >
    Minimum slope from IPC Section 417.5.2 (1/4\" per foot).
    Recommended slope (5/16\" per foot) is industry best practice, not code.
    Local codes may vary - verify with local jurisdiction.
  
  leveling_calculator: >
    Product coverage from manufacturer TDS.
    Substrate must meet ANSI A108.02 flatness after leveling.
    Primer required per product TDS - verify compatibility.
