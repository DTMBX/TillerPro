    - question: "How long will my project take?"
      answer: |
        Typical timelines:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Tile-only:</strong> 3–7 days</li>
          <li><strong>Shower rebuild:</strong> 1–2 weeks</li>
          <li><strong>Full remodel:</strong> 2–4 weeks</li>
        </ul>

          <li><strong>Deposit:</strong> Up to 1/3 at contract signing (covers materials)</li>
          <li><strong>Progress payments:</strong> At milestones based on work completed</li>

        All payment terms are detailed in your written contract per NJ HIC requirements.

- category: "Technical Standards & Methods"
  items:
    - question: "What is TCNA compliance?"
      answer: |
        The <strong>Tile Council of North America (TCNA)</strong> sets industry standards for tile installation. We follow TCNA methods for prep, waterproofing, and installation—no shortcuts. Most tile failures result from skipping these steps. <a href="/build/">Explore our Build Phase guides →</a>
    - question: "Do you perform flood testing?"
      answer: |
        Yes, when the project allows. Flood testing (ASTM D5957) checks shower pan waterproofing before tile is installed. Not all systems require it, but when done, we document results with photos. <a href="/build/flood-testing/">Learn about flood testing →</a>
    - question: "Which waterproofing systems do you use?"
      answer: |
        We use <strong>ANSI A118.10-compliant</strong> systems:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Sheet membranes:</strong> Schluter DITRA/KERDI, Laticrete Hydro Ban Board</li>
          <li><strong>Liquid membranes:</strong> Laticrete Hydro Ban, Custom RedGard</li>
          <li><strong>Traditional:</strong> Hot-mop or CPE liners (as needed)</li>
        </ul>
        We select the right system for your project and never mix incompatible products. <a href="/blog/waterproofing-redgard-vs-kerdi-vs-hydroban/">See our comparison of RedGard, KERDI, and HYDRO BAN.</a> <a href="/build/waterproofing-systems/">Learn about waterproofing →</a>
    - question: "Can you install large-format tile?"
      answer: |
        Yes. Large-format tile (over 15") needs:
        <ul>
          <li>Substrate flatness to ANSI specs (1/8" in 10')</li>
          <li>Full back-buttering</li>
          <li>Lippage control systems</li>
          <li>Medium-bed mortars if needed</li>
        </ul>
        We assess and prep as needed. <a href="/build/tile-installation-standards/">Learn about tile installation →</a>
    - question: "Do you install heated floors?"
      answer: |
        Yes, we install electric radiant floor heating under tile. This includes subfloor evaluation, uncoupling membrane, electrician coordination, and compatible thinset. Heated floors add comfort to any tiled space.

- category: "Materials & Products"
  items:
    - question: "Do you supply tile, or should I?"
      answer: |
        Either works:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>We supply:</strong> We source tile at trade pricing, handle ordering, delivery, and overage.</li>
          <li><strong>You supply:</strong> You choose and buy tile/grout; we advise on quantity and suitability.</li>
        </ul>
        We always include installation materials (thinset, waterproofing) in our scope.
    - question: "Which grout do you recommend?"
      answer: |
        We recommend <strong>epoxy or urethane grout</strong> for most jobs:
        <ul>
          <li>No sealing needed</li>
          <li>Consistent color</li>
          <li>Superior durability in wet areas</li>
        </ul>
        Cement grout is an option for some projects. We'll review choices and maintenance with you.
    - question: "Can I use natural stone in my shower?"
      answer: |
        Yes, with proper planning. Natural stone needs:
        <ul>
          <li>Sealing (initial and ongoing)</li>
          <li>Proper slope for drainage</li>
          <li>Compatible setting materials</li>
          <li>Realistic maintenance expectations</li>
        </ul>
        Some stones (like marble) are more porous and require more care. We'll discuss details during your consultation.
