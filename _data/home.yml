    $8,000 in mold remediation later. Your bathroom deserves better than "some guy."

  eyebrow: What We Actually Do (And Why Most Don't)
  title: Tile Work Worth Protecting
  summary: >
    We don't just "install tile." We build waterproof assemblies that pass flood tests, 
    use thinset with actual ISO ratings, and explain the difference between modified and non-modified 
    (because your marble installer better know). Not every project is a fit—but the right ones last decades.

      title: Showers That Don't Leak
      description: >
        ANSI A118.10 membranes (Schluter KERDI, Hydroban, not "some red stuff"). 
        1/4" per foot slope. 2-hour flood test. Because "it's probably fine" isn't a waterproofing strategy.
      details:
        - Flood-tested before tile (with photos you can show your spouse)
        - Seams done to spec, not spray-and-pray
        - Niches that don't become biology experiments
    - icon: tile
      title: Large-Format Tile (The Right Way)
      description: >
        24×48 porcelain needs C2-rated thinset, back-buttering, and lippage control systems. 
        We know this because we read the manual. Your "flooring guy" watches YouTube at 1.5× speed.
      details:
        - Heated floors that heat (DITRA-HEAT with actual thermostats)
        - Substrate flatness verified, not assumed
        - Lippage clips on every tile because your kitchen deserves it
    - icon: remodeling
      title: Slabs & Stone (Not For Everyone)
      description: >
        6mm gauged porcelain slabs. Book-matched marble. The stuff that makes your designer giddy 
        and requires A118.15 modified thinset and someone who won't crack your $900 accent piece.
      details:
        - Stone that's sealed correctly (penetrating, not that glossy garbage)
        - Fireplace surrounds that survive heat cycling
        - Porcelain slabs requiring a special insurance rider
    - icon: maintenance
      title: Fixing Someone Else's "Oops"
      description: >
        That shower leak? Probably no waterproofing membrane. Cracked tile? Deflection or wrong thinset. 
        We document what failed, explain why (with photos), and rebuild it so you're not calling us again in 18 months.
      details:
        - Leak autopsies with actual diagnosis
        - Tear-outs that reveal the horror stories
        - Documentation your insurance company actually accepts

    Jobs booked 4-8 weeks out because rushed tile is cracked tile.

  eyebrow: The Difference Between "Installed" and "Done Right"
  title: What Happens Before Tile Hits Wall
  summary: >-
    Here's the secret: anyone with a trowel can stick tile to a wall. Kindergartners with craft paste prove this daily. 
    The difference between a 5-year disaster and a 25-year bathroom? The stuff nobody sees. 
    We measure flatness. We calculate lippage. We actually *read* the thinset bag. Revolutionary, we know.
  steps:
    - title: "Step 1: Acknowledge Reality"
      description: >-
        Your walls aren't plumb. Your floor isn't flat. That's normal—houses settle. We measure deflection (L/360 limit), 
        check substrate flatness (1/8" in 10'), and locate the "surprise" moisture issues before they're surprises. 
        Ignoring this is how you get the "why is my tile cracking?" call.
    - title: "Step 2: Geometry That Makes Sense"
      description: >-
        We center tile from your shower door (what you see), not the back wall (what's easy). 
        We calculate grout joint widths so you don't get sliver cuts. We mock up patterns before mortaring. 
        Because "eyeballing it" is what gave you sliver cuts at the shampoo shelf.
    - title: "Step 3: The Stuff That Takes Time"
      description: >-
        Schluter membrane needs 24 hours. Thinset needs to cure. RedGard needs two coats. These aren't suggestions—they're 
        chemistry. Contractors who "finish early" skip steps. That's not hustle, that's future mold.
    - title: "Step 4: Think About Future You"
      description: >-
        Expansion joints at wall changes. Serviceable access to plumbing. Grout sealer applied (and explained). 
        So when you sell this house, the inspector doesn't find deferred maintenance, and the next owner doesn't curse your contractor choice.

  eyebrow: How Tillerstead Plans a Job
  title: Before We Touch Tile
  summary: >-
    Anyone can install tile. Planning is what makes it last.
    Every project starts with conditions, geometry, and execution strategy — not just material selection.
  steps:
    - title: 1. Existing Conditions
      description: >-
        Substrate flatness checks, deflection risk assessment, moisture exposure review, and out-of-plumb realities 
        documented before we propose a solution.
    - title: 2. Layout & Geometry
      description: >-
        Centering from sightlines (not walls), balanced cuts to avoid slivers, tile module math with grout joints, 
        and transition logic mapped out on paper first.
    - title: 3. Execution Strategy
      description: >-
        Prep sequencing, waterproofing system selection, inspection choke points identified, and cure times 
        respected — not rushed to meet arbitrary deadlines.
    - title: 4. Failure Prevention
      description: >-
        Movement accommodation at perimeter, expansion joints where planes change, and future serviceability 
        considered so the next contractor doesn't curse your name.
