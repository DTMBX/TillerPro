  eyebrow: How Tillerstead Plans a Job
  title: Before We Touch Tile
  summary: >-
    Anyone can install tile. Planning is what makes it last.
    Every project starts with conditions, geometry, and execution strategy — not just material selection.
  steps:
    - title: 1. Existing Conditions
      description: >-
        Substrate flatness checks, deflection risk assessment, moisture exposure review, and out-of-plumb realities 
        documented before we propose a solution.
    - title: 2. Layout & Geometry
      description: >-
        Centering from sightlines (not walls), balanced cuts to avoid slivers, tile module math with grout joints, 
        and transition logic mapped out on paper first.
    - title: 3. Execution Strategy
      description: >-
        Prep sequencing, waterproofing system selection, inspection choke points identified, and cure times 
        respected — not rushed to meet arbitrary deadlines.
    - title: 4. Failure Prevention
      description: >-
        Movement accommodation at perimeter, expansion joints where planes change, and future serviceability 
        considered so the next contractor doesn't curse your name.
