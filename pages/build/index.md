## The Build Phase

The **Build Phase** is Tillerstead’s standards-forward guide to bathroom and shower projects in New Jersey.  
It explains the *sequence*, the *verification points*, and the *common failure modes*—so expectations are clear before anything is sealed behind tile.

This is **not a DIY manual**. It’s an education and alignment resource for homeowners, designers, and contractors who want a durable, compliant result.


References include:

- TCNA Handbook methods
- ANSI tile standards
- ASTM testing guidance
- New Jersey Uniform Construction Code (UCC)

## Why These Guides Exist

Most bathroom failures don’t start with tile—they start earlier: at framing, waterproofing, slope, drainage, or skipped verification steps that are later hidden by finished surfaces.


These guides help you:

- Set clear expectations before construction begins
- Reduce surprises during the build
- Recognize quality workmanship
- Understand *why* each phase exists—not just *what* it is

---

## What We Build


- Code-aware bathroom and shower remodels planned around **permits, inspections, and verifiable system steps**
- Wet-area assemblies built as **systems** (structure → slope/drain → waterproofing → tile)
- Clear documentation habits (photos at key phases; verification before concealment)

## What We Don’t Do


- “Tile-over-problems” work that hides substrate, slope, or waterproofing issues
- Mixed-system waterproofing assemblies without manufacturer compatibility or engineering rationale
- Rushed sequencing that skips verification steps (especially before finishes conceal the work)

## The Construction Sequence: 8 Phases (Compliance Overview)

Each phase builds on the one before it. For the full picture, read in order. If you’re researching a specific issue, you can jump directly to the relevant phase. Each summary below links to a detailed guide.

---

### Phase 2: Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains
**[Full Guide](/build/shower-pans-slopes-drains/)**
- Water management before tile: slope, pan construction, and drainage.
- TCNA 2024 guidance on pan design and drainage.
- Why most failures originate here.

---

### Phase 3: Waterproofing Systems
**[Full Guide](/build/waterproofing-systems/)**

---

### Phase 5: Framing for Benches, Seats & Niches
**[Full Guide](/build/framing-benches-niches/)**
- Structural planning for benches, seats, and niches before waterproofing.
- TCNA 2024 methods for integrated structural details.

---

### Phase 6: Tile Installation Standards
**[Full Guide](/build/tile-installation-standards/)**
- Substrate prep, mortar selection, coverage, and movement joints.
- ANSI A108/A118, TCNA 2024 standards.

---

### Phase 7: Flood Testing & Verification
**[Full Guide](/build/flood-testing/)**
- ASTM D5957 flood testing methods.
- Verifying waterproofing before tile conceals the system.
- TCNA 2024 verification protocols.

---

### Phase 8: Common Failures & Red Flags
**[Full Guide](/build/common-build-failures/)**
- Where failures originate and warning signs.
- How proper sequencing prevents problems.
- TCNA 2024 failure analysis.

## The Build Phase Difference

| Shortcut Mentality           | Build Phase Method                |
|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------|
| Focus on finishes            | Focus on systems                   |
| Trust without verification   | Verify at each phase               |
| Problems hidden by tile      | Problems addressed early           |
| No documentation             | Photo & inspection documentation   |

> **The best projects are the ones where nothing has to be explained after the fact.**
