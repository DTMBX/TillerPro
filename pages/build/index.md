## Build Phase: Your Complete Guide to Bathroom & Shower Construction

Welcome to the **Build Phase**—a comprehensive, 8-part guide that walks you through every stage of a properly planned, built, and verified bathroom or shower project in New Jersey.

Whether you're a homeowner preparing for a remodel, comparing contractors, or just curious about what happens behind the walls, these guides give you the knowledge to make informed decisions.

---

## Why This Exists

Most bathroom failures don't happen because of bad tile or cheap fixtures. They happen because of **skipped steps, rushed sequencing, or unverified systems** earlier in the build.

These guides exist to:

- **Set clear expectations** before work begins
- **Reduce surprises** during construction
- **Help you partner effectively** with professionals

This is not a DIY manual. It's an **education and alignment resource** written in plain language.

## The 8 Phases of Construction

Each phase builds on the one before it. Read in order for the complete picture, or jump to the phase relevant to your project.

---

### Phase 1: Codes, Permits & Inspections

**Why permits exist, how inspections work, and what New Jersey actually requires.**

New Jersey uses a statewide code (UCC) with local enforcement. This guide explains the permit process, inspection sequence, and what inspectors are actually looking for.

**Key Topics:**

- Uniform Construction Code (UCC) overview
- When permits are required
- Typical inspection sequence
- Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)

**[Read Phase 1: Codes & Permits →](/pages/build/nj-codes-permits/)**

---

### Phase 2: Shower Pans, Slopes & Drains

**How water is directed safely to the drain before tile is installed—and why most failures start here.**

The shower pan is the foundation of a waterproof assembly. Get this wrong, and no amount of tile work will save it.

**Key Topics:**

- Slope requirements (¼" per foot minimum)
- Traditional vs. bonded pan systems
- Drain integration methods
- Pre-slope and final slope

**[Read Phase 2: Shower Pans →](/pages/build/shower-pans-slopes-drains/)**

---

### Phase 3: Waterproofing Systems

**Surface-applied vs. traditional systems, compatibility, and continuity.**

Modern waterproofing has evolved from hot-mopped pans to sheet and liquid-applied membranes. This guide covers ANSI A118.10 compliant systems and how to choose the right one.

**Key Topics:**

- Sheet vs. liquid-applied membranes
- ANSI A118.10 requirements
- System compatibility (don't mix!)
- Transitions, corners, and penetrations

**[Read Phase 3: Waterproofing →](/pages/build/waterproofing-systems/)**

---

### Phase 4: Curbs, Curbless Showers & Thresholds

**How showers contain water at the entry, with or without a curb.**

Curbless showers are popular for accessibility and aesthetics, but they require careful planning. This guide covers both traditional curbed and modern curbless approaches.

**Key Topics:**

- Curb construction methods
- Curbless shower requirements
- Threshold waterproofing
- ADA compliance considerations

**[Read Phase 4: Thresholds →](/pages/build/curbs-curbless/)**

---

### Phase 5: Framing for Benches, Seats & Niches

**Why structural planning matters before waterproofing and tile.**

Benches and niches need to be planned before waterproofing begins. Retrofitting them later compromises the entire assembly.

**Key Topics:**

- Bench framing and slope
- Niche construction guidelines
- Waterproofing integration
- Load-bearing considerations

**[Read Phase 5: Benches & Niches →](/pages/build/framing-benches-niches/)**

---

### Phase 6: Tile Installation & Coverage Standards

**How tile is bonded to the system—and why preparation matters more than tile choice.**

Tile installation is where most people focus, but it's actually the last step before grout. The substrate, mortar selection, and coverage are what determine long-term performance.

**Key Topics:**

- ANSI A108 installation standards
- Mortar selection (thinset types)
- Coverage requirements (80% min, 95% wet areas)
- Large-format tile considerations

**[Read Phase 6: Tile Installation →](/pages/build/tile-installation-standards/)**

---

### Phase 7: Flood Testing & Pre-Tile Verification

**How waterproofing is verified before finishes conceal the work.**

Flood testing is the only way to verify a shower pan works before tile makes repair impossible. This guide covers ASTM standards and documentation practices.

**Key Topics:**

- ASTM D5957 flood test procedure
- 24-hour vs. visual inspection
- Documentation and photography
- What happens if it fails

**[Read Phase 7: Flood Testing →](/pages/build/flood-testing/)**

---

### Phase 8: Common Failures & Red Flags

**Where problems originate, what warning signs to watch for, and how quality builds prevent them.**

Understanding common failures helps you recognize quality work—and spot shortcuts before they become expensive problems.

**Key Topics:**

- Waterproofing failures
- Tile disbonding causes
- Grout and caulk failures
- Warning signs during construction

**[Read Phase 8: Common Failures →](/pages/build/common-build-failures/)**

| Phase                | Focus               | Key Standard           |
| -------------------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1. Codes & Permits   | Legal requirements  | NJ UCC, IRC            |
| 2. Shower Pans       | Water direction     | TCNA B421, B422        |

| 7. Flood Testing     | Verification        | ASTM D5957             |
| 8. Common Failures   | Prevention          | Industry best practice |

## How to Use These Guides

### If You're New to Remodeling

Start with **Phase 1** and read through in order. Each phase builds on the previous one, so you'll understand the full construction sequence.

### If You're Researching a Specific Issue

Jump directly to the relevant phase. Each guide is self-contained with enough context to be useful on its own.

### If You're Comparing Contractors

Ask potential contractors about their approach to each phase. Quality contractors will welcome questions; corner-cutters will deflect.

### If You're a Contractor

These guides can help align expectations with homeowners. Share them as part of your proposal process.

## The Build Phase Difference

What makes this approach different from "just installing tile"?

| Traditional Approach    | Build Phase Methodology          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Focus on tile selection | Focus on system assembly         |
| "Trust the installer"   | Verify at each phase             |
| Finish hides problems   | Problems addressed before finish |
| No documentation        | Photo documentation standard     |
| Warranty on tile        | Warranty on workmanship          |

> **The best projects are the ones where nothing has to be explained after the fact.**
