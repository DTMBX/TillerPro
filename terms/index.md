## Terms & Conditions

**Last updated:** December 2025

## 1. Licensed New Jersey Contractor

Tillerstead LLC (“we,” “our,” “us”) is a New Jersey–licensed and insured Home Improvement
Contractor operating under NJ HIC License #{{ site.company.hic }}. Our services comply with
the New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and Home Improvement Practices regulations,
N.J.A.C. 13:45A-16.

## 2. Estimates, Proposals & Written Agreements

- Initial estimates are non-binding and based on information available at the time.
- Formal proposals include required details such as scope of work, materials, start dates, pricing, and payment schedules as required by N.J.A.C. 13:45A-16.2.
- No work begins until the client accepts a proposal in writing (email is acceptable) and a deposit is received.
- Proposals are valid for 30 days unless otherwise stated.

## 3. Required New Jersey Disclosures

New Jersey law requires the following disclosures for home improvement projects:

- The contractor’s legal name, address, phone number, and HIC license number.
- A clear description of all work to be performed.
- The total price or a formula for determining final price.
- Start and completion dates, or an estimated timeline.
- A statement of the customer’s right to cancel certain agreements.

### Right to Cancel (Three-Day Rule)

For eligible in-home sales covered by N.J.A.C. 13:45A-16, clients may cancel the contract
within three business days of signing. Instructions for cancellation are provided in each

## 6. Change Orders (Required by N.J.A.C. 13:45A-16.2)

Any change to scope, materials, price, or timeline requires a written change order

misunderstandings and ensuring full transparency.
