- question: "What is the Build Phase?"
  answer: "The Build Phase is a step-by-step guide that mirrors how properly permitted bathroom and shower projects unfold in New Jersey. It covers everything from codes and permits through final verification, helping you understand what should happen on your project and why each phase matters."

- question: "Do I need to read all eight guides?"
  answer: "Not necessarily. If you're preparing for a remodel, start with Codes, Permits & Inspections and work through in order. If you're researching a specific issue, jump to the chapter that addresses your concern. Each guide stands on its own."

- question: "Are these guides only for homeowners?"
  answer: "No. Homeowners use them to understand their project and evaluate contractors. Contractors reference them as standards-based documentation. Inspectors and architects find them helpful for alignment on code expectations in New Jersey."

- question: "What standards do these guides reference?"
  answer: "The guides reference the TCNA 2024 Handbook (Tile Council of North America), ANSI standards (A108, A118.10, A118.12), and New Jersey building code requirements. We cite standards so you can verify the advice independently if needed."

- question: "Can I use these guides as a DIY manual?"
  answer: "These guides are educational—they explain what happens and why. They are not installation instructions. Tile and waterproofing work requires proper tools, training, and code compliance. We recommend hiring licensed professionals."

- question: "What if my inspector wants something different than what these guides say?"
  answer: "The guides reflect typical New Jersey practice and TCNA standards, but local interpretations vary by jurisdiction and inspector. Always confirm expectations with your code official early in the project. These guides help you have informed conversations with them."

- question: "How do these guides relate to Tillerstead's services?"
  answer: "Tillerstead builds projects using the methodologies described in these guides. The guides are educational for anyone—they're not marketing material. We publish them because we believe homeowners deserve to understand how quality bathroom work actually works."

- question: "Are there specific product recommendations in the guides?"
  answer: "The guides focus on system design and assembly principles, not specific brands. Product selection depends on budget, site conditions, and code requirements. We discuss compatibility and continuity, which matter more than brand."

- question: "Can I link to these guides or share them?"
  answer: "Yes. These guides are published for public education. Share them with contractors, inspectors, friends planning remodels, or anyone interested in understanding proper bathroom construction."

- question: "How often are these guides updated?"
  answer: "As New Jersey codes change, TCNA standards are revised, or we learn from real projects, these guides are updated. Check back periodically for the latest information."
