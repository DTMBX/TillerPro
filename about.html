    <h2 id="details-heading">Why Tyler Focuses on Details</h2>
    <p>
      Tile problems usually dont start at the surface. They start underneath: poor substrate prep, inadequate flatness, skipped movement accommodation, or a wet area that was never built as a true waterproofing assembly. Thats why Tyler's work begins with verificationthen he builds the system to the requirements of the selected method and materials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tyler doesnt treat mortars and membranes as interchangeable. Material selection follows published specifications (including applicable ANSI classifications and manufacturer data sheets), and movement accommodation is planned and installed where required (including TCNA EJ171 guidance for movement joints).
    </p>
    <p>
      In showers and wet areas, Tyler constructs waterproofing as a complete assemblyincluding transitions, penetrations, and drain integrationthen verifies before tile. Where testing is required or method-appropriate, he performs it and documents it.
    </p>
    <p class="muted">
      Tyler's goal is simple: fewer surprises, fewer callbacks, and a bathroom you dont have to think about.
