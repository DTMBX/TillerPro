\## Photographic Failure-Mode Reference Map (Tile + Wet Areas + Floors)



\*\*Version:\*\* 1.0  

\*\*Owner:\*\* Tyler  

\*\*Purpose:\*\* Provide “photographic memory” anchors for technical explanations, client education, QA checklists, and post-mortems.  

\*\*Use Rule:\*\* Every technical output must anchor to \*\*at least one\*\* failure mode below and describe it as if referencing a jobsite photo.



---



\## How to Use This Map (Operational)

When discussing a technique, product, or news item, run this internal chain:



\*\*Topic → Assembly → Failure Mode(s) → Visual Anchor → Root Cause(s) → Fast Diagnostics → Prevention Spec → Client Consequence\*\*



---



\## Universal Root-Cause Buckets (Use These First)

Most tile failures reduce to one (or more) of these:



1\. \*\*Movement not accommodated\*\* (perimeter/field joints, transitions, changes of plane)  

2\. \*\*Substrate not suitable\*\* (deflection, flatness, bonding surface, contamination)  

3\. \*\*Coverage / bond failure\*\* (trowel selection, collapse, back-butter, open time)  

4\. \*\*Water management failure\*\* (no waterproofing, discontinuity, bad drains, penetrations)  

5\. \*\*Material mismatch\*\* (mortar/grout selection vs use, tile type, thermal exposure)  

6\. \*\*Cure / environment issues\*\* (temperature, rapid drying, freezing, early loading)

\# FM-01 — Cracked Grout (Random or Patterned)

\## “Photo Look”

\- Hairline cracks following traffic paths or spanning multiple joints

\- Wider cracks along joist lines or transitions

\- Corners/cracks at changes of plane



\## Primary Root Causes

\- Substrate movement/deflection (common)  

\- Grout washed out / overwatered mixing or cleanup  

\- Movement joints missing at perimeter/field/changes of plane  

\- Marginal subfloor build-up or underlayment attachment



TCNA notes grout commonly fails due to substrate movement or improper grout installation. :contentReference\[oaicite:2]{index=2}



\## Fast Diagnostics (Jobsite)

\- Tap test tile near crack: hollow sound = likely bond/coverage or movement

\- Check perimeter: is tile hard-tight to walls/base? (no movement gap)

\- Check transitions: doorway thresholds, cabinetry kicks, islands

\- Ask: “When did it start?” (early = install; later = movement/seasonal)



\## Prevention Spec (Executive Standard)

\- Treat movement as design requirement (perimeter + field joints as needed) :contentReference\[oaicite:3]{index=3}

\- Confirm subfloor stiffness/underlayment suitability and fastening

\- Grout: correct mix ratio, minimal water, proper cure conditions



\## Client Consequence

\- Cosmetic starts first, then water/movement escalates; repairs become partial demo.



---



\# FM-02 — Hollow / Loose Tile (Debond)

\## “Photo Look”

\- Tile sounds hollow; sometimes “click” under foot

\- Grout cracks around one tile

\- Loose tile lifts clean with mortar mostly on one side



\## Primary Root Causes

\- Inadequate mortar coverage / poor trowel technique

\- Skinned mortar (open time exceeded)

\- Dust/contamination on substrate or tile backs

\- Wrong mortar type for tile/assembly (e.g., requirements for specific mortars)



\## Fast Diagnostics

\- Lift one sacrificial tile: mortar transfer pattern tells truth

\- Look for ridges not collapsed / no key-in coat

\- Check for powdery substrate surface or primer needed



\## Prevention Spec

\- Correct trowel + key-in + directional troweling + ridge collapse

\- Use mortar meeting appropriate ANSI performance category for the application (e.g., A118 classes as relevant). :contentReference\[oaicite:4]{index=4}



\## Client Consequence

\- Localized repairs rarely hold if root cause is systemic technique or substrate.



---



\# FM-03 — Tenting / “Popped Tile” (Compression Failure)

\## “Photo Look”

\- A ridge or “bubble” line; tiles lifted like a hinge

\- Sudden failure sometimes after heat/sun or seasonal change

\- Often starts mid-field or near constrained perimeters



\## Primary Root Causes

\- No movement accommodation (hard-tight perimeter, no soft joints)

\- Tile bonded over active joints without honoring them

\- Thermal expansion (sunlit floors, darker tile, exterior, radiant, big glass)



Movement-joint guidance is commonly referenced via TCNA EJ171. :contentReference\[oaicite:5]{index=5}



\## Fast Diagnostics

\- Check perimeter under base/shoe: is there a gap or is tile jammed?

\- Check if grout is hard at changes of plane (no sealant joint)

\- Look for cracks aligned with slab/control joints



\## Prevention Spec

\- Perimeter and field movement joints designed intentionally (not optional)

\- Honor substrate joints through the tilework where required



\## Client Consequence

\- Safety hazard and rapid cascade failure; usually requires larger-area correction.



---



\# FM-04 — Lippage / Poor Plane Control

\## “Photo Look”

\- Edges catch socks; shadow lines across floor

\- Worse on large-format tile; worse in raking light

\- Often appears as “waves” across a run



\## Primary Root Causes

\- Substrate flatness not achieved before setting

\- Warped tile + poor layout/offset decisions

\- Inconsistent mortar thickness / poor collapse / rushing



\## Fast Diagnostics

\- Straightedge across multiple tiles: measure peaks/valleys

\- Identify whether lippage tracks substrate dips or tile warpage pattern



\## Prevention Spec

\- Make flatness a precondition (prep before you set)

\- Control layout decisions (offsets, running bond choices)

\- Use appropriate leveling strategy \*only after\* substrate prep



\## Client Consequence

\- Aesthetic + safety; often cannot be “fixed” without reset.



---



\# FM-05 — Water Intrusion (Showers / Wet Areas)

\## “Photo Look”

\- Dark grout that never dries

\- Swollen baseboards outside shower

\- Staining at ceiling below; loose bottom-row tiles

\- Musty odor



\## Primary Root Causes

\- Missing waterproofing or discontinuity at seams/corners/penetrations

\- Incorrect drain integration / slope issues

\- Fasteners or penetrations through critical waterproof zones



\## Fast Diagnostics

\- Moisture readings (if available), visual weep points, perimeter inspection

\- Inspect corners/valves/niches for continuity and seal integrity



\## Prevention Spec

\- Waterproofing continuity is treated as a system, not a product

\- Flood test where applicable before finish work (project dependent)



\## Client Consequence

\- Hidden structural damage; insurance/claims become complicated; remediation costs climb.



---



\# FM-06 — Efflorescence / Mineral Staining

\## “Photo Look”

\- White crystalline haze on grout/tile

\- Returns after cleaning; worse near edges or damp zones



\## Primary Root Causes

\- Moisture migration through mortar bed or slab

\- Excess water in grout, cure conditions, or ongoing moisture source

\- In wet areas: water management design issue



\## Fast Diagnostics

\- Identify moisture source; check perimeter and below-grade conditions

\- Determine whether deposits are mineral (efflorescence) vs cleaner residue



\## Prevention Spec

\- Solve moisture source first; do not “clean” your way out

\- Use appropriate materials and cure conditions



\## Client Consequence

\- Persistent appearance issues; may signal deeper moisture problem.



---



\# FM-07 — Soft / Powdery Grout

\## “Photo Look”

\- Grout scratches out with a key

\- Sandy residue; joints low or washed



Common causes include too much water, washing too early/aggressively, or poor joint filling. :contentReference\[oaicite:6]{index=6}



\## Fast Diagnostics

\- Check joint depth and hardness in multiple areas

\- Review cleaning timing and mix ratios



\## Prevention Spec

\- Control water; pack joints fully; proper cure; avoid harsh acids early



\## Client Consequence

\- Early failure and staining; joints become maintenance liabilities.



---



\# FM-11 — Transition Cracking (Mixed Materials)

\## “Photo Look”

\- Crack line at doorway or material change

\- Repeats seasonally; worsens with traffic



\## Primary Root Causes

\- Movement mismatch; no transition detail

\- Substrate joint not honored; hard grout where sealant should be

\- Assembly changes without isolation



\## Prevention Spec

\- Treat transitions as engineered details (movement + isolation)



\## Client Consequence

\- “Recurring repair” trap if detail is not rebuilt correctly.



---



\## Photo Capture \& Naming Standard (Build Your Library)

Use a consistent tag system so posts can reference “that exact failure photo.”



\*\*Filename format:\*\*

`YYYY-MM-DD\_\_FM-XX\_\_location\_\_room\_\_note.jpg`



\*\*Example:\*\*

`2026-01-26\_\_FM-03\_\_AtlanticCounty\_\_kitchen\_\_tented\_midfield.jpg`



\*\*Minimum photo set per failure:\*\*

\- Wide context shot

\- Close-up of symptom

\- Edge detail (perimeter / transition)

\- If demo occurs: bond/coverage underside photo



---



\## “Caption Templates” (Tyler Voice)

\- “This is what movement looks like when it has nowhere to go.”

\- “This hollow sound isn’t cosmetic. It’s bond loss telling on itself.”

\- “Water doesn’t need a big hole. It needs one weak seam.”



---
