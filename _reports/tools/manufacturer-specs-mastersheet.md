## TCNA/ANSI Compliance Quick Reference

### Mortar Coverage Requirements (ANSI A108)

| Application | Minimum Coverage | Edge Support | Back-Butter |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| Dry interior floors | 80% | Recommended | Optional |
| Wet areas (showers, etc.) | 95% | Required | Required |
| Exterior | 95% | Required | Required |
| Large format tile (≥15") | 95% | Required | Required |
| Natural stone | 95% | Required | Required |

### Substrate Flatness Requirements (ANSI A108.02)

| Tile Type | Max Variation in 10 ft | Max Variation in 12" | Max Variation in 24" |
|-----------|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Standard tile (<15" edges) | 1/4" | 1/16" | — |
| Large format tile (≥15" edge) | 1/8" | — | 1/16" |
| Natural stone | 1/8" | — | 1/16" |

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** If substrate does not meet flatness tolerances, lippage standards do NOT apply. Installer cannot be held responsible for lippage caused by out-of-tolerance substrate.

### Deflection Requirements (TCNA)

| Tile Type | Maximum Deflection |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Ceramic tile | L/360 |
| Natural stone | L/720 |

*L = span length in inches. Example: 10 ft (120") span ÷ 360 = 0.33" max deflection*

### Grout Joint Requirements (ANSI A108.02)

| Tile Type | Minimum Joint Width |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Absolute minimum (all tile) | 1/16" |
| Rectified tile | 1/8" |
| Calibrated (non-rectified) | 3/16" |
| Handmade/rustic | 1/4"+ |

**Rule:** Joint width ≥ 3× tile facial dimensional variation

### Movement Joint Requirements (TCNA EJ171)

| Location | Spacing | Minimum Width |
|----------|---------|---------------|
| Interior, normal | 20-25 ft | 1/8"-3/16" |
| Interior, sunlit/heated | 8-12 ft | 3/16"-1/4" |
| Exterior | 8-12 ft | 1/4"-1/2" |
| Perimeter (at walls) | All perimeters | 1/4" minimum |

> ⚠️ **CRITICAL:** All substrate movement/control joints MUST be honored through the tile installation. Movement joints filled with sealant (ASTM C920), NOT grout.

## PRO NOTES: Installation Best Practices

### Mortar Application

1. **Comb Direction:** Comb mortar in ONE direction only (not swirling)
2. **Ridge Collapse:** Press tile perpendicular to ridges to collapse and eliminate voids
3. **Verify Coverage:** Periodically lift tiles to confirm coverage (especially first few tiles)
4. **Open Time:** If ridges don't collapse, scrape and re-apply fresh mortar
5. **Key-In:** Apply thin layer to substrate before combing for improved bond

### Large Format Tile (≥15")

1. **Trowel Selection:** Use U-notch or ridged trowel—NOT 1/2" square (per CBP TDS)
2. **Back-Butter:** Required on every tile for 95% coverage
3. **Offset Limit:** Maximum 33% offset for running bond (not 50%)—reduces lippage
4. **Leveling System:** Use clips and wedges for consistent lippage control
5. **Substrate Prep:** MUST meet LFT flatness tolerance (1/8" in 10 ft) before starting

### Waterproofing

1. **Coat Direction:** Apply coats in perpendicular directions (cross-hatch pattern)
2. **Thickness Verification:** Use mil gauge to verify wet film thickness
3. **Corner Treatment:** Embed fabric/mesh tape in FIRST coat at all corners and seams
4. **Penetrations:** Seal around ALL penetrations—valves, pipes, drains
5. **Flood Test:** Test before tiling—plug drain, fill 1-2" above threshold, hold 24-48 hours
6. **KERDI Specific:** MUST use unmodified thinset (ANSI A118.1)—modified will NOT bond

### Grout Application

1. **Consistency:** Mix to peanut butter consistency—not too wet
2. **Slaking:** Let rest 5-10 minutes after mixing, then remix briefly
3. **No Water:** Do NOT add water after slaking—weakens grout
4. **Diagonal Push:** Work grout diagonally across joints, not parallel
5. **Cleaning Window:** Clean when grout firms (fingerprint test)—not too soon, not too late
6. **Curing:** Keep cement grout damp for 72+ hours; do not seal for 28 days

### Common Failure Prevention

| Issue | Prevention |
|-------|------------|
| Hollow/cracked tiles | Verify ≥80/95% mortar coverage; back-butter LFT |
| Lippage | Verify substrate flatness; use leveling system; limit offset |
| Cracked grout | Verify deflection; install movement joints per TCNA EJ171 |
| Water intrusion | Proper membrane thickness; flood test; treat all penetrations |
| Membrane failure | Two coats required; reinforce corners; use correct thinset for sheet membrane |
