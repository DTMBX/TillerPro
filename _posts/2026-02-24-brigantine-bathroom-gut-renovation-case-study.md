# 1960s Bathroom Gut Renovation: Brigantine, NJ Before & After

**Project Location:** Brigantine, NJ (Atlantic County)  
**Completion Date:** January 2026  
**Project Duration:** 18 days  
**Project Type:** Full gut renovation

---

## Project Overview

When Sarah and Tom contacted us about their 1960s Brigantine beach house, they had one request: **"Make it not pink."**

Their master bathroom was a time capsule—original pink tile, matching pink toilet, and a shower/tub combo that had seen better days. After 60+ years, the waterproofing had failed, causing hidden mold behind the walls.

This case study covers the complete renovation: demo, mold remediation, modern TCNA-compliant installation, and stunning transformation.

## The Problems

### Aesthetic Issues
- ❌ Original 1964 pink ceramic tile (walls and floor)
- ❌ Dated pink toilet and pedestal sink
- ❌ Cast iron bathtub (chipped, rusted)
- ❌ Fluorescent lighting (builder-grade)
- ❌ Small medicine cabinet (minimal storage)
- ❌ No ventilation (original window only)

### Functional Issues
- ❌ **Mold growth** behind shower walls (discovered during demo)
- ❌ **No waterproofing membrane** (1960s didn't use them)
- ❌ **Rotted studs** from decades of water infiltration
- ❌ Plumbing leaks (original galvanized steel pipes)
- ❌ Inadequate electrical (no GFCI outlets)
- ❌ Poor layout (wasted space, inefficient traffic flow)

### Building Code Violations
- ❌ No waterproofing (ANSI A118.10 required since 2015)
- ❌ No GFCI protection (NEC requirement)
- ❌ Insufficient ventilation (80 CFM exhaust required)
- ❌ Non-compliant plumbing (old venting)

## Client Goals

**Must-Haves:**
1. Modern, timeless design (no trendy colors)
2. Larger walk-in shower (no tub)
3. Double vanity (couple uses space simultaneously)
4. Heated tile floor
5. Modern lighting
6. Maximum storage

**Nice-to-Haves:**
1. Rainfall showerhead + handheld
2. Built-in bench and niche
3. Frameless glass enclosure
4. Natural stone accents

## Challenges Overcome

### Challenge #1: Hidden Mold

**Problem:** During demo, discovered black mold behind entire shower area. Original installation had no waterproofing, and 60 years of moisture infiltrated walls.

**Solution:**
1. Full containment with plastic sheeting
2. HEPA filtration during remediation
3. Antimicrobial treatment of all affected surfaces
4. Replaced 3 rotted studs
5. Air quality testing before proceeding
6. **Cost:** +$800 (remediation) + $650 (framing)

**Lesson:** Always budget 10-15% contingency for hidden issues in pre-1980s homes.

### Challenge #2: Outdated Plumbing

**Problem:** Original galvanized steel pipes (1964) were corroded and restrictive. New fixtures wouldn't work properly with old plumbing.

**Solution:**
- Complete re-pipe with PEX
- Updated venting to current code
- Relocated shower valve for better positioning
- **Cost:** +$320 (materials) + 1 day labor

**Benefit:** Better water pressure, no future corrosion, easier future repairs.

### Challenge #3: Floor Leveling

**Problem:** Original floor had 1.5" slope across 9-foot span (common in 1960s beach houses due to settling).

**Solution:**
- Self-leveling compound (Mapei Ultraplan)
- Raised low areas to match high point
- Verified flat with 6-foot level
- **Cost:** +$280 (materials + labor)

**Result:** Perfect substrate for large-format tile (required for proper adhesion).

### Challenge #4: Electrical Capacity

**Problem:** Original electrical panel at 80% capacity. Adding heated floor + exhaust fan would exceed safe load.

**Solution:**
- Coordinated with electrician to add dedicated 20A circuit
- Upgraded panel breaker
- GFCI protection throughout
- **Cost:** Included in electrical labor
