# Waterproofing Membrane Comparison: Schluter Kerdi vs Laticrete Hydroban vs RedGard

**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026 | **Reading Time:** 10 minutes

Look, I've installed over 200 tile showers in the last 15 years, and I'm going to tell you something that might surprise you: **The membrane matters more than the tile.**

Seriously. You can put $20/sq ft marble over a bad membrane and it'll leak. Or you can put $3/sq ft ceramic over a proper membrane and it'll be bone-dry for 30 years.

Choosing the right waterproofing membrane is like choosing a foundation for your house—nobody sees it, but mess it up and the whole thing crumbles. I've personally torn out $40,000 showers that failed because someone skimped on a $400 membrane.

This is my completely unfiltered comparison of the three waterproofing systems I actually use: **Schluter Kerdi**, **Laticrete Hydroban**, and **Custom RedGard**. I'm not getting paid by any of them (though Schluter, if you're reading this, I accept bribes in pre-formed corners).

## Why This Comparison Matters (And Why Your Contractor Might Be Lying)

Some contractors will tell you "all membranes are the same." Those contractors either don't know what they're doing, or they're using whatever's cheapest and hoping you don't notice.

Here's the truth: Not all ANSI A118.10 membranes are created equal. They all meet the minimum standard (that's what A118.10 means), but installation difficulty, cost, durability, and warranty vary **wildly**.

I've seen contractors:
- Use liquid RedGard on a curbless shower (rookie move—sheet membrane required)
- Try to mix Schluter components with Laticrete drains (voided both warranties)
- Skip pre-formed corners to save $30 (cost the homeowner $8,000 in repairs)

Don't be that homeowner.

## Why Waterproofing Matters (And What Happens When It Fails) {#why-waterproofing-matters}

**Water doesn't need much to destroy your home.** A gap the width of a human hair can let thousands of gallons seep into your walls over a few years.

### War Story: The Brigantine Disaster

**Brigantine, NJ - Summer 2025**

Got a call from a panicked homeowner. "Tyler, there's a weird smell in the bathroom and the ceiling below is stained."

I already knew what I'd find.

Pulled off one tile (it practically fell off on its own). The cement board behind it was black. Not gray. Not spotted. **Black.** Like someone painted it with mold.

Turns out the previous "contractor" (let's call him Larry the Liability) used "water-resistant" backer board with **no membrane**. Larry told them, "This board is waterproof—it says so right on it!"

**The Results:**
- 3 years of showers = water seeping through grout
- Black mold covering 90% of shower walls
- Mold spores in HVAC ducts (kid had asthma symptoms for months)
- Total damage: **$38,000** (tear-out, mold remediation, rebuild)
- Insurance claim: **DENIED** (improper installation)

Larry? Disappeared. Phone disconnected. Business name changed. Classic.

**What Larry Got Wrong:**
❌ "Water-resistant" board ≠ waterproof (huge difference)  
❌ No ANSI A118.10 membrane (required by NJ code since 2015)  
❌ No flood test (would've caught it immediately)  
❌ Field-cut corners (proper corners are pre-formed)

That $400 membrane Larry skipped to save money? Cost the homeowner **$38,000**.

Don't hire Larry.

### What Waterproofing Actually Does

Let me explain this because too many people get it wrong:

**Tile is NOT waterproof.** Neither is grout. Both are porous—water goes right through them.

The waterproofing membrane **behind** the tile is what keeps water from reaching your studs, insulation, and drywall.

Think of it like a raincoat. The tile is your outer jacket (looks nice, provides some protection). The membrane is the waterproof layer underneath (does the actual work).

**Building Code Reality (New Jersey):**
- ANSI A118.10 compliant membrane = **MANDATORY** since 2015
- Inspectors actually check for this
- No membrane = failed inspection = project stops = you pay for re-work

> **Critical Fact That'll Save You $40K:** Tile and grout are NOT waterproofing. They're decorative surfaces over a waterproof membrane. If your contractor says "we don't need a membrane because we're using premium grout," run. Fast.

## ANSI A118.10: The Magic Number You Need to Know {#ansi-compliance}

### What Is ANSI A118.10? (And Why Should You Care?)

**ANSI** = American National Standards Institute  
**A118.10** = "Specification for Load Bearing, Bonded, Waterproof Membranes for Thin-Set Ceramic Tile and Dimension Stone Installation"

**In Plain English:** It's the industry standard that separates real waterproofing from wishful thinking.

When a product is "ANSI A118.10 compliant," it means it passed rigorous testing to prove it can actually keep water out. When it's not... well, you're basically trusting magic and hope.

### What Makes A118.10 Special?

**Performance Requirements** (aka "The Gauntlet"):
- **Hydrostatic pressure:** Must withstand 330 feet of water pressure (14.3 PSI) - that's like having a 30-story building of water pushing on it
- **Crack bridging:** Must stay waterproof even when substrate cracks up to 1/8" (because concrete cracks, always)
- **Temperature range:** -20°F to 180°F without failure (NJ winters + hot showers)
- **UV exposure:** 30+ days in direct sunlight without degrading
- **Mold resistance:** Must not support mold growth (critical in humid NJ)

**Testing Protocol** (No Shortcuts):
- 28-day water immersion test (not 24 hours—28 DAYS)
- 10+ freeze/thaw cycles minimum
- Crack isolation testing (simulates structural movement)
- Bond strength verification (won't delaminate)

Manufacturers can't just claim compliance—they have to prove it with independent lab testing. That's why A118.10 matters.

### The Confusion: "Water-Resistant" vs. Waterproof

This is where homeowners get scammed. Let me settle this once and for all:

| Feature | ANSI A118.10 Membrane | "Water-Resistant" Board |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Actually waterproof | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (moisture resistant only) |
| NJ code compliant | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (for wet areas) |
| Can bridge cracks | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Requires flood test | ✅ Yes | ❌ N/A |
| Manufacturer warranty | ✅ 10-50 years | ❌ Varies (usually none) |

**Here's the scam:** "Water-resistant" cement board (HardieBacker, Durock, etc.) is NOT waterproofing. It's the substrate you install waterproofing **on top of**.

Saying cement board is waterproofing is like saying drywall is insulation. It's not—it's what you put insulation behind.

> **Translation Guide:**
> 
> **What they say:** "We use waterproof cement board—you don't need a membrane"  
> **What they mean:** "I'm cutting corners and hoping you don't know better"  
> **What you should do:** Run. Fast.

**Bottom Line:** You need cement board AND membrane. Board is the substrate. Membrane is the waterproofing. Both required by code.

## The Big Three: Schluter vs. Laticrete vs. RedGard {#systems-overview}

After installing over 200 showers with these systems, here's my brutally honest take on each.

### Market Reality (2026)

**1. Schluter Kerdi** - ~40% market share
- Premium German engineering
- Most comprehensive system (everything integrates)
- Highest price, highest quality
- **My take:** The Mercedes of waterproofing

**2. Laticrete Hydroban** - ~35% market share  
- Sheet AND liquid options (versatility)
- Professional contractor favorite
- Mid-range pricing, excellent performance
- **My take:** The Honda of waterproofing (reliable, proven)

**3. Custom RedGard** - ~25% market share
- Liquid-applied focus
- DIY-friendly (available at big box stores)
- Budget-friendly pricing
- **My take:** The Toyota of waterproofing (economical, gets the job done)

All three are ANSI A118.10 compliant—they meet the minimum standard. The differences are in **installation difficulty**, **cost**, **component ecosystem**, and **long-term performance**.

None of them are "bad." But they're different, and which one you choose depends on your project, budget, and who's installing it.

## Schluter Kerdi: The German Engineering Approach {#schluter-kerdi}

### My Honest Opinion

I use Schluter on 70% of my jobs. It's more expensive, but it's the most **foolproof** system I've ever used.

Why? Because Schluter thought of everything. Every corner, every transition, every edge case has a pre-engineered solution. You're not field-fabricating anything—you're assembling German-engineered components that fit together perfectly.

Is it overkill for a basic tub/shower combo? Maybe. But I sleep better at night knowing that shower won't leak.

## Common Installation Mistakes {#common-mistakes}

### All Systems

❌ **Mistake #1: Skipping Corners**
- Using field-cut membrane at corners
- **Fix:** Always use pre-formed corners (Kerdi-Kereck, Laticrete corners, etc.)

❌ **Mistake #2: Insufficient Overlap**
- Not overlapping seams enough
- **Fix:** 2" minimum, 2.5" recommended for all seams

❌ **Mistake #3: No Flood Test**
- Tiling immediately without testing
- **Fix:** 24-hour flood test (2" water depth minimum)

❌ **Mistake #4: Wrong Thinset**
- Using incompatible thinset
- **Fix:** Check manufacturer specs (Kerdi = unmodified, others = modified)

### Schluter Kerdi-Specific

❌ **Using Modified Thinset**
- Voids warranty, prevents membrane from bonding
- **Fix:** Use Kerdi-Coll or unmodified thinset only

❌ **Not Fully Embedding Membrane**
- Air pockets behind Kerdi
- **Fix:** Flatten thinset with flat trowel, then apply Kerdi, then flatten again

### Laticrete Hydroban Liquid

❌ **Too Thin Application**
- Not achieving 60-mil wet thickness
- **Fix:** Use notched trowel or measure with wet film gauge

❌ **Tiling Too Soon**
- Not waiting 16-24 hours
- **Fix:** Patience. Let it cure fully.

### Custom RedGard

❌ **Single Coat**
- Trying to save time with one thick coat
- **Fix:** Always minimum 2 coats, preferably 3

❌ **Roller Marks**
- Leaving heavy texture
- **Fix:** Back-roll to smooth, or use brush for final coat

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use Kerdi membrane with Laticrete thinset?

**A:** No. Schluter Kerdi requires **unmodified thinset** or Kerdi-Coll. Laticrete thinsets are typically modified. Using modified thinset with Kerdi **voids the warranty** because the polymers in modified thinset prevent the Kerdi fleece from bonding properly.

### Q: Is RedGard really waterproof enough?

**A:** Yes, when properly applied. RedGard is ANSI A118.10 compliant and used in thousands of showers successfully. The key is **proper application**: 2-3 coats, full coverage, no thin spots. Professional contractors sometimes avoid it because labor cost (3 coats) offsets material savings.

### Q: Which system is best for curbless showers?

**A:** Schluter Kerdi or Laticrete Hydroban Board. Both offer pre-sloped foam pans that make curbless installations much easier. RedGard requires traditional mortar bed sloping, which is harder to execute perfectly for curbless designs.

### Q: Can I mix systems (e.g., Kerdi pan with Hydroban walls)?

**A:** **Not recommended.** Manufacturers only warranty their complete systems. Mixing brands creates liability issues and potential compatibility problems. Stick with one system for the entire shower.

### Q: Do I still need cement board under these membranes?

**A:** **Yes** (except Hydroban Board, which combines both). Waterproof membranes require a stable substrate:
- Schluter Kerdi: Apply over cement board or Kerdi-Board
- Laticrete Hydroban Liquid: Apply over cement board
- Laticrete Hydroban Board: No cement board needed (self-contained)
- RedGard: Apply over cement board

### Q: How long do these warranties really last?

**A:** Warranty duration ≠ actual lifespan. All three systems can last 30-50+ years with proper installation. The warranty is insurance against manufacturing defects and installation errors (if professionally installed). Laticrete's 25-year warranty is the longest and most comprehensive.

---

## Conclusion: The Verdict

**Best Overall:** **Laticrete Hydroban (Liquid or Board)**
- Mid-range pricing + premium performance + longest warranty = best value
- Flexibility (liquid or sheet) fits any project
- 25-year warranty provides peace of mind

**Best Premium:** **Schluter Kerdi**
- Fastest installation for pros
- Most complete system
- Industry standard for high-end work

**Best Budget:** **Custom RedGard**
- 40-60% cost savings
- DIY-friendly
- Adequate performance for non-critical applications

**My Professional Recommendation:**
- **Your Forever Home:** Schluter Kerdi
- **Most Projects:** Laticrete Hydroban
- **Rental/Budget:** Custom RedGard

All three are ANSI A118.10 compliant and will keep water out **when properly installed**. The difference is in cost, installation speed, and long-term warranty support.
