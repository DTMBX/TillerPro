# Waterproofing Membrane Comparison: Schluter Kerdi vs Laticrete Hydroban vs RedGard

**Last Updated:** February 10, 2026 | **Reading Time:** 10 minutes

Choosing the right waterproofing membrane is the **single most important decision** in your tile shower installation. Get it wrong, and you're looking at water damage, mold growth, and a $15,000-40,000 tear-out and rebuild.

After installing over 200 showers with these three systems, I'm sharing unfiltered insights on **Schluter Kerdi**, **Laticrete Hydroban**, and **Custom RedGard**—the three most popular ANSI A118.10 compliant membranes in 2026.

## Why Waterproofing Matters {#why-waterproofing-matters}

**Water doesn't need much to destroy your home.** A pinhole gap in waterproofing allows thousands of gallons to seep into walls over just a few years.

### The Real Cost of Waterproofing Failure

**Case Study: Brigantine, NJ (2025)**
- Homeowner used "waterproof tile backer board" without membrane
- 3 years later: Black mold behind all shower walls
- **Total damage:** $38,000 (tear-out, mold remediation, rebuild)
- **Insurance:** Denied (improper installation)

**What Went Wrong:**
- ❌ Relied on "water-resistant" backer board (NOT waterproof)
- ❌ No ANSI A118.10 membrane installed
- ❌ No flood test performed
- ❌ Improper corners (field-cut, not pre-formed)

### What Waterproofing Actually Does

**Primary Function:** Creates a **continuous barrier** that prevents water from reaching the substrate (studs, wood, drywall).

**Secondary Function:** Allows the tile assembly to be a "wet area" without structural damage.

**Building Code Requirement (NJ):** ANSI A118.10 compliant membrane mandatory for all shower installations since 2015 IRC adoption.

> **Critical Fact:** Tile and grout are NOT waterproof. They're porous. The membrane behind the tile is what keeps water out.

---

## ANSI A118.10 Compliance Explained {#ansi-compliance}

### What Is ANSI A118.10?

**ANSI** = American National Standards Institute  
**A118.10** = "Specification for Load Bearing, Bonded, Waterproof Membranes for Thin-Set Ceramic Tile and Dimension Stone Installation"

**In Plain English:** The industry standard that defines what qualifies as a waterproof membrane for tile installations.

### Key Requirements

**Performance Standards:**
- Hydrostatic pressure resistance: 330 feet (14.3 PSI minimum)
- Crack bridging: Must maintain waterproofing over 1/8" substrate cracks
- Temperature range: -20°F to 180°F without failure
- UV exposure: 30+ days without degradation
- Mold resistance: Must not support mold growth

**Testing Protocol:**
- 28-day water immersion test
- Freeze/thaw cycles (10 minimum)
- Crack isolation testing
- Bond strength verification

### ANSI A118.10 vs. "Water-Resistant"

| Feature | ANSI A118.10 Membrane | "Water-Resistant" Board |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Waterproof | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (moisture resistant only) |
| Code Compliant | ✅ Yes | ❌ No (for wet areas) |
| Crack Bridging | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| Flood Test | ✅ Required | ❌ N/A |
| Warranty | ✅ 10-50 years | ❌ Varies |

**Bottom Line:** Don't confuse "water-resistant" cement board with waterproofing. You need **both**—backer board PLUS membrane.

## Common Installation Mistakes {#common-mistakes}

### All Systems

❌ **Mistake #1: Skipping Corners**
- Using field-cut membrane at corners
- **Fix:** Always use pre-formed corners (Kerdi-Kereck, Laticrete corners, etc.)

❌ **Mistake #2: Insufficient Overlap**
- Not overlapping seams enough
- **Fix:** 2" minimum, 2.5" recommended for all seams

❌ **Mistake #3: No Flood Test**
- Tiling immediately without testing
- **Fix:** 24-hour flood test (2" water depth minimum)

❌ **Mistake #4: Wrong Thinset**
- Using incompatible thinset
- **Fix:** Check manufacturer specs (Kerdi = unmodified, others = modified)

### Schluter Kerdi-Specific

❌ **Using Modified Thinset**
- Voids warranty, prevents membrane from bonding
- **Fix:** Use Kerdi-Coll or unmodified thinset only

❌ **Not Fully Embedding Membrane**
- Air pockets behind Kerdi
- **Fix:** Flatten thinset with flat trowel, then apply Kerdi, then flatten again

### Laticrete Hydroban Liquid

❌ **Too Thin Application**
- Not achieving 60-mil wet thickness
- **Fix:** Use notched trowel or measure with wet film gauge

❌ **Tiling Too Soon**
- Not waiting 16-24 hours
- **Fix:** Patience. Let it cure fully.

### Custom RedGard

❌ **Single Coat**
- Trying to save time with one thick coat
- **Fix:** Always minimum 2 coats, preferably 3

❌ **Roller Marks**
- Leaving heavy texture
- **Fix:** Back-roll to smooth, or use brush for final coat

---

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: Can I use Kerdi membrane with Laticrete thinset?

**A:** No. Schluter Kerdi requires **unmodified thinset** or Kerdi-Coll. Laticrete thinsets are typically modified. Using modified thinset with Kerdi **voids the warranty** because the polymers in modified thinset prevent the Kerdi fleece from bonding properly.

### Q: Is RedGard really waterproof enough?

**A:** Yes, when properly applied. RedGard is ANSI A118.10 compliant and used in thousands of showers successfully. The key is **proper application**: 2-3 coats, full coverage, no thin spots. Professional contractors sometimes avoid it because labor cost (3 coats) offsets material savings.

### Q: Which system is best for curbless showers?

**A:** Schluter Kerdi or Laticrete Hydroban Board. Both offer pre-sloped foam pans that make curbless installations much easier. RedGard requires traditional mortar bed sloping, which is harder to execute perfectly for curbless designs.

### Q: Can I mix systems (e.g., Kerdi pan with Hydroban walls)?

**A:** **Not recommended.** Manufacturers only warranty their complete systems. Mixing brands creates liability issues and potential compatibility problems. Stick with one system for the entire shower.

### Q: Do I still need cement board under these membranes?

**A:** **Yes** (except Hydroban Board, which combines both). Waterproof membranes require a stable substrate:
- Schluter Kerdi: Apply over cement board or Kerdi-Board
- Laticrete Hydroban Liquid: Apply over cement board
- Laticrete Hydroban Board: No cement board needed (self-contained)
- RedGard: Apply over cement board

### Q: How long do these warranties really last?

**A:** Warranty duration ≠ actual lifespan. All three systems can last 30-50+ years with proper installation. The warranty is insurance against manufacturing defects and installation errors (if professionally installed). Laticrete's 25-year warranty is the longest and most comprehensive.

---

## Conclusion: The Verdict

**Best Overall:** **Laticrete Hydroban (Liquid or Board)**
- Mid-range pricing + premium performance + longest warranty = best value
- Flexibility (liquid or sheet) fits any project
- 25-year warranty provides peace of mind

**Best Premium:** **Schluter Kerdi**
- Fastest installation for pros
- Most complete system
- Industry standard for high-end work

**Best Budget:** **Custom RedGard**
- 40-60% cost savings
- DIY-friendly
- Adequate performance for non-critical applications

**My Professional Recommendation:**
- **Your Forever Home:** Schluter Kerdi
- **Most Projects:** Laticrete Hydroban
- **Rental/Budget:** Custom RedGard

All three are ANSI A118.10 compliant and will keep water out **when properly installed**. The difference is in cost, installation speed, and long-term warranty support.
