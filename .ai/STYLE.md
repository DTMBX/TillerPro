---

## CORE VOICE DEFINITION

### Primary Voice: "The Competent Professional Who Refuses to Suffer Fools"

- **Technical but Accessible**: Use industry terminology, explain when necessary
- **Confident Without Arrogance**: "We know our stuff" not "We're better than you"
- **Self-Aware Humor**: Acknowledge when we're being particular or pedantic
- **Direct & Honest**: Say what needs saying, even if uncomfortable

---

## PERSUASION FRAMEWORK: 48 LAWS APPLIED TO TILE

### Law 1: Never Outshine the Master (Make Clients Feel Smart)
- **Application**: Frame expertise as empowering clients to make informed decisions
- **Language**: "You deserve to know why..." / "Here's what they don't tell you..."
- **Example**: "You're asking the right questions—here's what substrate deflection actually means..."

### Law 4: Always Say Less Than Necessary (Be Intriguing)
- **Application**: Hint at depth of knowledge without overwhelming
- **Language**: Drop technical terms with brief explanations, not lectures
- **Example**: "TCNA standards (the 412-page handbook most contractors haven't opened)"

### Law 6: Court Attention at All Cost (Be Bold & Memorable)
- **Application**: Use provocative headlines and memorable phrases
- **Language**: Headlines that challenge assumptions or make bold claims
- **Example**: "The Tile Work That Outlasts the Mortgage"

### Law 16: Use Absence to Increase Respect (Create Scarcity)
- **Application**: Signal selectivity, limited availability
- **Language**: "Booked 4-8 weeks out" / "Not every project is a fit"
- **Example**: "We turn down jobs that can't be done right"

### Law 27: Create a Cult Following (Offer a Belief System)
- **Application**: Position TCNA compliance as the "correct way" vs. "winging it"
- **Language**: "The right way" / "Industry standards" / "How it should be done"
- **Example**: "TCNA-compliant installations vs. 'some guy who watches YouTube'"

### Law 28: Enter Action with Boldness (Be Direct & Confident)
- **Application**: Make definitive claims backed by technical knowledge
- **Language**: Confident declarations, not hedging
- **Example**: "Cracked tile? It's deflection or wrong thinset. Always."

### Law 30: Make Accomplishments Seem Effortless
- **Application**: Show mastery through casual deployment of expertise
- **Language**: Technical terms used naturally, not pompously
- **Example**: "We check substrate flatness (1/8\" in 10' for rectified tile)—basic stuff"

### Law 33: Discover Each Man's Thumbscrew (Target Pain Points)
- **Application**: Address specific frustrations with past contractors
- **Language**: "You've been ghosted..." / "No more 'I'll call you back' that never happens"
- **Example**: "Texts returned same-day. Not 'left on read' for three weeks."

### Law 37: Create Compelling Spectacles (Make Work Visible)
- **Application**: Photo documentation, flood test results, progress updates
- **Language**: Visual proof, documented processes
- **Example**: "Flood test photos you can show your skeptical spouse"

### Law 43: Work on Hearts and Minds of Others
- **Application**: Make clients *want* to work with you through values alignment
- **Language**: Shared frustration with poor craftsmanship
- **Example**: "Built for long-term performance, not short-term profit"

---

## TONE VARIATIONS BY CONTEXT

### Homepage/Hero Sections: Bold & Provocative
- Make big claims backed by specifics
- Challenge assumptions about tile work
- **Example**: "The Tile Work That Outlasts the Mortgage"

### Service Descriptions: Detailed & Differentiated
- Show depth of knowledge through specificity
- Contrast proper methods with common shortcuts
- **Example**: "C2-rated thinset, not 'whatever's at the truck'"

### About/Process Pages: Personality-Driven
- Inject humor and self-awareness
- Address client frustrations directly
- **Example**: "We're the kind of annoying that measures substrate flatness"

### Technical Content: Authoritative but Human
- Lead with standards and specs
- Explain why they matter in plain language
- **Example**: "ANSI A108.10 waterproofing (because 'probably fine' isn't a plan)"

---

## LANGUAGE PATTERNS

### Power Words (Use Frequently)
- **Documented**: Implies others don't document
- **Tested**: (flood tested, ohm tested) - shows rigor
- **Standards-Compliant**: TCNA, ANSI, OSHA
- **Licensed**: With specific HIC number (#13VH10808800)
- **Verified**: (flatness verified, coverage verified)
- **Accountable**: Direct owner involvement
- **Realistic**: (timelines, expectations)
- **Preventive**: (planning prevents failures)

### Humor Patterns
1. **Self-Deprecating Pedantry**: "Yes, we're annoying about..."
2. **Absurdist Comparisons**: "Kindergartners with craft paste..."
3. **Exaggerated Obviousness**: "Revolutionary concept: answering the phone"
4. **Sarcastic Air Quotes**: "Some guy" / "probably fine" / "red paint"
5. **Parenthetical Asides**: "(imagine that)" / "(shocking, we know)"

### Technical Specificity Patterns
Always pair technical terms with practical implications:
- "L/360 deflection limit (so your tile doesn't crack)"
- "95% thinset coverage (TCNA 2024 update for large-format)"
- "1/4\" per foot slope (proper drainage prevents standing water)"

### Contrast Patterns (Proper vs. Shortcut)
Format: `[Proper method] not [shortcut version]`
- "Schluter KERDI membrane, not red paint from the box store"
- "Modified thinset with C2 rating, not whatever's on sale"
- "Substrate flatness verified, not assumed"
- "Texts returned same-day, not left on read"

---

## SENTENCE STRUCTURE

### Headlines: Bold Declarations or Provocative Questions
- "Built to Last. Installed with Judgment."
- "The Tile Work That Outlasts the Mortgage"
- "What Happens Before Tile Hits Wall?"
- "Showers That Don't Leak (Revolutionary Concept)"

### Body Copy: Mix of Technical and Conversational
**Rhythm**: Short punchy sentence. Longer explanatory sentence with technical detail. Payoff/humor.

**Example**: 
> Your walls aren't plumb. Your floor isn't flat. That's normal—houses settle. We measure deflection (L/360 limit), check substrate flatness (1/8\" in 10'), and locate the moisture issues before they're surprises. Ignoring this is how you get the 'why is my tile cracking?' call.

### Bullet Points: Specificity + Implication
Format: `[Bold claim]: [Technical details]. [Why it matters or what others do wrong].`

**Example**: 
> **Waterproof showers that don't leak**: Schluter KERDI membranes installed to spec. Flood tested before tile. Seam details done correctly. Because 'probably fine' isn't a waterproofing strategy.

## POSITIONING: THE ANTI-CORNER-CUTTER

### What We Are
- **Standards-Compliant Professional**: TCNA, ANSI, OSHA by the book
- **Documentation-Obsessed**: Photo logs, written scopes, inspection checklists
- **Communication-Focused**: Same-day text responses, realistic timelines
- **Owner-Operated**: Tyler on every job, direct accountability
- **Selective**: Turn down jobs that can't be done right

### Contrast Without Naming
**Never say**: "Other contractors cut corners"  
**Instead say**: "We measure substrate flatness (most don't)"

**Never say**: "Competitors are unlicensed"  
**Instead say**: "Ask your quote for their HIC number. We'll wait."

**Never say**: "They use wrong materials"  
**Instead say**: "C2-rated thinset with ISO 13007 certification (not 'whatever's on sale')"

## VOICE EXAMPLES

### Before (Generic)
> "We provide quality tile installation services with attention to detail and customer satisfaction."

### After (Tillerstead Voice)
> "We install tile the annoying way: substrate flatness verified, thinset coverage at 95%, and flood testing before a single tile goes in. Slower than 'some guy.' More expensive than the Craigslist quote. But you only pay once."
