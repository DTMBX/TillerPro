| Schluter ALL-SET | C2TE S1 | Universal modified |

**Selection Criteria**:
- **Porcelain tile** (water absorption <0.5%): Modified thinset required
- **Natural stone** (marble, limestone): Often non-modified to prevent staining
- **Shower floors**: Slope-specific thinset or deck mud (portland cement)
- **Large format**: C2 rating minimum, extended open time formulas

### Waterproofing Systems

#### Sheet Membrane Systems
- **Schluter KERDI**: 8-mil polyethylene, thinset bonded, instant waterproofing

- **Mapei Aquadefense**: Green product, low VOC, crack-bridging
- **Kerdi-Fix** (Schluter): Waterproofing sealant/adhesive for seams

#### Code Requirements (NJ)
- **Shower pan waterproofing**: Mandatory per IRC Section P2709
- **Height**: Must extend 3" above showerhead rough-in (minimum 72" from drain)
- **Curbless showers**: Waterproofing must extend entire bathroom floor

### Grout Technology

- **Limitation**: Not for pools or constant water immersion

**3. Polymer-Modified Cement Grout**
- Standard residential choice
- Requires sealing (penetrating, not topical)
- **Brands**: Polyblend Plus, Permacolor
- **Joint size**: 1/16" - 1/2" (sanded for >1/8")

#### Grout Joint Requirements
- **Rectified tile**: Minimum 1/16" joint (3/32" recommended)
- **Non-rectified**: 3/16" minimum
- **Floor tile >15"**: 3/16" - 1/4" minimum (expansion concerns)

- Comb substrate with notched trowel
- Beat in tile with rubber mallet or tile beater

**3. Lippage Control Systems**
- **T-Lock/Tuscan**: Clips and wedges prevent lippage during cure
- **Raimondi Leveling System**: Similar concept, different mechanism
- Use on all LFT installations, especially rectified porcelain

**4. Trowel Selection**
| Tile Size | Trowel Size |
|-----------|-------------|
| 12"×12" to 18"×18" | 1/2" × 1/2" square notch |

## MODERN BEST PRACTICES (2024-2025)

### Shower System Selection

**Traditional Mud Bed** (declining use):
- Time-intensive, requires skilled labor
- Cost: $1,500-3,000 for pan alone
- Best for: Historic restoration, commercial

**Schluter System** (industry standard 2024):
- KERDI waterproofing + prefab components
- Cost: $800-1,500 for materials
- Best for: Residential remodels, fast installation

**Wedi System** (premium alternative):
- XPS foam boards, fully integrated system
- Cost: $1,000-2,000 for materials
- Best for: High-end residential, lightweight applications

### Grout Joint Width Philosophy

**2024 Industry Shift**:
- **Old standard**: 1/16" joints for rectified tile
- **New recommendation**: 3/32" minimum (TCNA 2024)
- **Reasoning**: Allows for slight size variation, easier installation, reduces lippage
- **Shadow lines**: Larger joints (3/16"-1/4") create intentional design element

### Floor Heating Integration
- **Systems**: Electric mat (120V/240V) most common in NJ residential
- **Brands**: Schluter DITRA-HEAT, Warmup, SunTouch, NuHeat
- **Installation**: Between subfloor and tile (under thinset)

## RED FLAGS & COMMON ISSUES

### Installation Failures to Avoid
1. **Insufficient thinset coverage** → hollow spots, cracking
2. **Wrong thinset type** → delamination (non-modified with porcelain)
3. **Poor substrate prep** → deflection, improper fastening
4. **Grout sealing negligence** → staining, water penetration
5. **Inadequate waterproofing** → mold, rot, structural damage
6. **Ignoring deflection limits** → grout cracking, tile tenting

### NJ-Specific Concerns
- **Hurricane-prone region**: Proper window flashing critical
- **Freeze-thaw cycles**: Exterior tile must be frost-proof (<0.5% water absorption)
- **High humidity**: Proper ventilation required (exhaust fans) per code
- **Older housing stock**: Lead paint/asbestos testing may be required
