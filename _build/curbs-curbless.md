# Curbs, Curbless Showers & Thresholds

## Step 4 of the Construction Order — Containing Water at the Entry

This page explains **why shower curbs exist**, how curbless showers are permitted in New Jersey, and what inspectors are evaluating when reviewing thresholds and transitions.

This guide follows **TCNA 2024 Handbook** threshold design methods for curbless configurations and curb detailing.

Curbs are not decorative. They are a water-containment device.

---

## The Code Intent (Plain Language)

> **The shower entry must prevent water from leaving the wet area under normal use and during temporary drain restriction.**

Whether achieved with a curb or a curbless design, the goal is the same: **containment and control**.

---

## Curbed Showers (Traditional Thresholds)

When a shower includes a curb, model plumbing codes adopted by New Jersey typically expect:

* A finished curb height **at least 2 inches above the drain**
* A curb that is not excessively wide or unsafe
* Waterproofing that fully wraps the curb

### What “2 inches above the drain” actually means

* Measured from the **top of the drain grate** to the **finished curb surface**
* Not measured from the bathroom floor
* Applies only when a curb is present

This requirement addresses splash-out and overflow risk.

---

## Curbless Showers (Zero-Threshold)

Curbless showers are **not prohibited** in New Jersey residential construction, but they are treated as **performance-based designs**.

Instead of relying on a curb, water containment is achieved through:

* Floor elevation planning
* Additional slope outside the wet area
* Strategic drain placement
* Drain capacity and grate design

> Removing the curb increases planning responsibility—it does not remove requirements.

---

## Common Curbless Design Strategies

Inspectors may accept curbless showers when they see:

* Continuous slope directing water inward
* Linear or trench drains placed at the entry
* Secondary slope outside the shower zone
* Clear waterproofing continuity beyond the wet area

Early coordination with the AHJ is strongly recommended.

---

## Accessibility vs. Residential Use

Accessibility standards (Barrier-Free Subcode / ICC A117.1) apply **only when legally triggered**, such as:

* Accessible dwelling units
* Public or common-use bathrooms

Standard residential remodels are **not automatically subject** to accessibility requirements, even when curbless designs are chosen.

---

## Waterproofing at Thresholds

Regardless of curb type:

* Waterproofing must be continuous across the threshold
* Transitions are common failure points
* Fasteners through horizontal waterproofing surfaces are prohibited

Thresholds must be treated as part of the waterproofing system, not as trim.

---

## Inspection Focus Areas

Inspectors commonly look for:

* Finished curb height relative to the drain
* Waterproofing continuity at the entry
* Evidence of planned water control
* Compatibility of drain and waterproofing system

Visual clarity and coherent design reduce inspection friction.

# Curbless Shower Rebuild Reference

This document provides a field-ready sequence for constructing a true curbless (zero-threshold) shower and supporting planning equations suitable for estimator or calculator tools. Calculations are planning aids only; verify all measurements and code requirements on site.

## Definitions

* **True curbless / zero-threshold:** A shower floor that maintains a continuous slope (target 1/4 in. per ft.) from the dry-side entry to the drain while keeping the finished bathroom floor flush at the transition, with waterproofing extending under the entire sloped plane.
* **Recessed-entry / barrier-reduced:** A shower area that lowers the structural or mortar build-up near the entry to soften the transition but still requires a minor bevel or trim piece; used when full flushness cannot be achieved without structural modification.

## Step-by-step build sequence

1. **Selective demolition and substrate exposure**  
   Remove finishes down to sound framing or concrete, extending past the planned wet area so adjoining flooring can be feathered.
2. **Framing or recess strategy (when required)**  
   Notch or lower joists only when structurally approved, or install engineered recess systems to gain depth without compromising load paths; reinforce sistered members as specified.
3. **Subfloor prep and flatness verification**  
   Check the exposed deck with straightedges; correct deflection, delamination, or fastener withdrawal before introducing slope.
4. **Slope planning and calculations**  
   Confirm drain location, measure the longest run to the entry, and document required drop using the equations below; mark perimeter control lines.
5. **Mortar-bed floating and shaping**  
   Place bonded or unbonded deck mud per substrate requirements, keeping minimum thickness at the drain per manufacturer instructions and striking planes to the marked elevations.
6. **Waterproofing installation (continuous plane)**  
   Extend sheet or liquid membrane beneath the entire sloped area and at least 12 in. into the dry zone; overlap seams per system specs and embed reinforcing at all changes of plane.
7. **Drain integration and membrane termination**  
   Match the drain body to the membrane type (e.g., bonding flange with sheet membrane); clamp, bond, or weld per system requirements and protect weep pathways.
8. **Flood testing and documentation**  
   Plug the drain, fill to the highest perimeter point, record start/stop times, waterline marks, and photo evidence; maintain a minimum 24-hour dwell or local requirement (verify locally).
9. **Tile installation and movement accommodation**  
   Use thinset compatible with the membrane, maintain trowel orientation downhill, honor soft joints at perimeters, and coordinate transitions to adjacent flooring.
10. **Final inspection and quality verification**  
    Confirm slope with digital level readings, verify flush entry, document drain operation, and log waterproofing lot numbers or approvals for closeout.

## Planning equations

* **Required drop (inches):** `drop_in = distance_to_drain_ft × slope_rate_in_per_ft`
* **Perimeter elevation (inches):** `perimeter_height_in = drain_flange_height_in + drop_in`
* **Average mortar-bed thickness (inches):** `avg_thickness_in = (drain_thickness_in + perimeter_thickness_in) ÷ 2`

**Variables**  
* `distance_to_drain_ft`: longest run from entry to drain center (ft)  
* `slope_rate_in_per_ft`: commonly 0.25 in./ft.; adjust only when permitted by design professional  
* `drain_flange_height_in`: finished height at drain connection (including membrane build)  
* `perimeter_thickness_in`: planned mortar height at the farthest point

> Calculators must flag that outputs are preliminary; adjust for framing deflection, tile thickness, and manufacturer minimums before installation.

### Distance-to-drop reference (1/4 in. per ft.)

| Distance to drain (ft) | Required drop (in.) |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | 0.25 |
| 2 | 0.50 |
| 3 | 0.75 |
| 4 | 1.00 |
| 5 | 1.25 |

## Common failure conditions

* Flat floors where slope was assumed but never verified with measurements or flood tests.
* Sudden plane changes or improvised ramps at entries that trap water or create trip hazards.
* Interrupted or patchworked waterproofing that leaves joints, seams, or penetrations unsealed.
* Mixing drains and membranes that are not designed to work together, resulting in delamination or clogged weep channels.
* Treating curbless as "no rules"
* Flat bathroom floors outside the shower
* Waterproofing stopping at the shower opening
* Fasteners penetrating curbs or thresholds
Always verify structural allowances, plumbing approvals, and inspection criteria with the local authority before work proceeds.




These issues often require tear-out to correct.

## Key Takeaways

* Curbs exist to contain water
* Curbless showers rely on performance, not exemption
* Thresholds are part of the waterproofing system
* Early planning prevents late rejection
