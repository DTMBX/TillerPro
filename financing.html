                Flexible Payment Solutions for Lasting Tile &amp; Bath Projects
            </h1>
            <p class="lead">
                At Tillerstead, we believe every project deserves uncompromising quality—regardless of budget. Our flexible payment options and expert guidance ensure you never have to sacrifice durability or craftsmanship.
            </p>
            <p>
                Every project begins with a detailed written scope and a transparent plan. Our installation methods strictly follow TCNA standards and manufacturer guidelines, so you can trust your investment will stand the test of time.
            </p>
            <h2 class="heading-3">Payment Options Tailored to You</h2>
            <ul class="financing-options ts-list">
                <li>
                    <strong>Pay in Full:</strong> Perfect for smaller projects or when you want the fastest turnaround.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Milestone-Based Payments:</strong> Start with a deposit, then pay as each phase is completed and verified—so you’re always in control.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Phased Project Approach:</strong> Focus on what matters most now (like waterproofing and showers), with the option to complete additional work later—without compromising quality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Third-Party Financing:</strong> Instantly check offers from trusted lenders via Acorn Finance. No obligation, no impact on your credit to pre-qualify.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="heading-3">How Our Process Works</h2>
            <ol class="financing-steps">
                <li>
                    <strong>Consult &amp; Plan:</strong> We visit your site, take precise measurements, and develop a written scope. If phasing is best, we’ll map out each step together.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Transparent Proposal:</strong> Receive a clear, line-item estimate with defined scope, schedule, and terms—so there are no surprises.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Select Payment Option:</strong> Choose the payment structure that fits your needs, or check third-party financing offers online in minutes.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <p class="microcopy">
                Financing is always optional. We never cut corners or skip critical prep to "make the numbers work." If needed, we’ll phase your project—so you get lasting results, not costly shortcuts.
