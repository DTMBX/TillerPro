        <h3>4.1 Estimates</h3>
        <p>
          Estimates provided through this website or in person are for informational purposes 
          only and do not constitute a binding contract. Final pricing is determined after 
          site evaluation and is documented in a written contract before work begins.
        </p>

        <h3>4.2 Scope of Work</h3>
        <p>
          The specific work to be performed, materials to be used, and project specifications

          must be documented in a written change order signed by both parties.
        </p>

        <h3>4.3 Industry Standards</h3>
        <p>
          Our tile installation work references published industry standards including the 
          TCNA 2024 Handbook and applicable ANSI A108/A118 specifications. References to 
          these standards describe methods and quality benchmarks; they do not imply 
          certification or endorsement by the Tile Council of North America or other 
          standards organizations.
        </p>

        <h3>4.4 Subcontractors</h3>
        <p>
          Work requiring specialty licenses (plumbing, electrical) will be performed by 
          appropriately licensed subcontractors. All subcontractors are required to maintain 
          applicable licenses and insurance.
